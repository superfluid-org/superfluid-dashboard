#TODO: Test cases that are broken/will get changed or no functionality yet
#Scenario: Stream details page for a stream with just start date
#Scenario: Stream details page for a stream with start and end date ( Not started yet )
#Scenario: Searching for a recent receiver
#Not working atm, create test case when fixed
#Scenario: Changing time units in the send page
#Rounding is kind of off atm, and there is no rounding solution for now,
#There is a test case to check the previews, but will create the case with changing time units when it works precisely
